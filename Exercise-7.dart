  /*Exercise 7
Letâ€™s say you are given a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write a Dart code that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
   */
  List<int> a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100];
  List<int> evenList=[];
  a.forEach((i) {
    // print(i);
    if(i %2 == 0){
      evenList.add(i);
    }
  });
  print(evenList);
